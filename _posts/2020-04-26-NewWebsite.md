I've been putting this off. No question about it. But with the current coronavirus shutdown, I've decided its time to finally tackle my lab website. I have had a good run with the website I prepared using iWeb, but that program hasn't been updated since 2014 and clearly won't be an option moving forward. So here I am, sitting in my home office learning how to update my website on Github. With the help of Ben Barad (big thanks!) and my entire lab, we have put together this new website for the Wiseman lab. Yes, we definitely stole the design from Jamie Fraser's lab at UCSF. I'm not proud of it, but it was just SO much easier (and Ben, who was in the Fraser lab, said it would be fine). We hope this new site reflects the collaborative, welcoming, and curious environment in the Wiseman lab and appropriately highlights the exciting work being performed by the exceptional scientists in our group. However, we are always looking for ways to improve the site, so if you have any suggestions, please let us know. But for now (or whenever I decide to release this to the public), enjoy! - RLW -
