I am Senior Computational Chemist at [Bicycle Therapeutics](https://www.bicycletherapeutics.com/). I employ AI and Physics based methods at various stages of drug discovery. To know more about my role at Bicycle Therapeutics contact me at amin.sagar@bicycletx.com.<br>
Before joining Bicycle Therapeutics, I was a postdoctoral researcher in [Structural and Function of Highly Flexible Proteins group](http://www.cbs.cnrs.fr/index.php/en/home-equipea2) at [Center de Biologie Structurale](http://www.cbs.cnrs.fr/index.php/en/), where I studied polydisperse biomolecular systems using solution scattering and computation.
